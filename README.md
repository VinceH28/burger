## General info
 A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## Setup
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
